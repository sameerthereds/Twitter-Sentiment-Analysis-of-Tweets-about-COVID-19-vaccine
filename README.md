# Twitter Sentiment Analysis of COVID-19 Vaccine Tweets

## Overview
In the field of natural language processing, sentiment analysis plays a crucial role in scientific and commercial applications such as recommendation systems and data mining. Social media platforms like Twitter, YouTube, Facebook, and Reddit generate vast amounts of user data, which can be analyzed to understand public opinions on various topics, including elections, sports, and COVID-19.

## Importance of Twitter Sentiment Analysis
Twitter, with its widespread adoption and high user engagement, has become a major focus for sentiment analysis research. As of 2021, Twitter had 192 million daily active users and nearly 500 million tweets per day. The U.S. alone had about 70 million monthly active users, making it an important data source for public health, business, major events, and political decisions.

## Project Objective
This project explores Twitter Sentiment Analysis (TSA) to analyze the general opinion of people regarding the COVID-19 vaccines. As of recent reports, global COVID-19 cases surpassed 124 million, with nearly 30 million cases in the U.S. The pandemic has resulted in approximately 3 million deaths worldwide and over half a million in the U.S.

With the accelerated development and FDA approval of three vaccines—Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, and Janssen—mass vaccination is critical to achieving herd immunity and returning to pre-pandemic life. However, increasing vaccine hesitancy, as reported by *The Economist*, threatens progress against COVID-19. TSA provides insights into public perceptions of the vaccines, helping policymakers and researchers address concerns.

## Approach
Previous works in sentiment analysis have focused on COVID-19-related tweets using keywords such as *coronavirus* and *COVID-19*. This project specifically analyzes sentiments regarding COVID-19 vaccines rather than the pandemic itself. It examines polarity, subjectivity, and emotional tones in tweets mentioning the three FDA-approved vaccines.

## Conclusion
This project provides valuable insights into how people perceive COVID-19 vaccines through Twitter sentiment analysis. By understanding public sentiment, researchers and policymakers can develop strategies to combat misinformation and improve vaccine adoption rates.
